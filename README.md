# GraphCentrality  
>This project provides a tool to calculate graph's centrality measures : Degree Centrality ,Closeness Centrality and Betweenness Centrality.  
>The measure are implemented in C++ from scratch.  
>The project also provides a DrawTool to visualize the graph , implemented in python.  

## Installing DrawTool 's dependencies
1- Install latest python version from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" >here</a>  
2- Download pip from <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py">here</a>  
3- Run on python's terminal <code>$ python get-pip.py</code>  
4- Run on python's terminal <code>$ pip install matplotlib </code>  
5- Run on python's terminal <code>$ pip install networkx</code>  
6- Run our DrawTool.py present in our repo.  
7- Add a nodes.txt file and write down in it your input where the first line contains the nodes count then a space then the edges count , the following lines will contain the edges in the following form : NodeFrom *a space* NodeTo *a space* weight. You can also view testcases.txt to view examples of the input.
